### Bash To Its Limits (SH)
A repository for testing the functionality of bash scripting.


## Uses.
# Introduction.
Bash is a shell, much like Window's Command Prompt (or CMD, suffix: .bat), and is usually run on Linux-based systems.
This programming language is (pretty much) only used for scripting.
The following are uses for this language.
# Automation.
Bash can be used to automate certain things.
This is most useful for start up scripts and for running a lot of different Linux commands at once.
# Games.
Although, you might not think that this programming language could possibly be used for games, but you would be wrong. Have you ever heard of the game "Oregon Trail"? That game was originally programmed (with out graphics) in a language much similar to Bash.


## Basic Commands.
# Directory-Based.
Change Directory:
```bash
cd
```

Example:
Changes to the directory of ``directory/subdirectory``
```bash
cd directory/subdirectory
```

Move:
```bash
mv
```

Example:
Moves ``directory/subdirectory/filename.program`` to ``newfile.newprogram``
```bash
mv directory/subdirectory/filename.program newfile.newprogram
```

# Helpful To Know.
If you don't know what a command does, type in ``man <command>`` into a Linux shell window and it will tell you what it does.
